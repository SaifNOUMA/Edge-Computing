# Edge-Computing

* As a key technology of enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in 5G era, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have quicly attracted widespread attention. However, it is challenging to run computation intense DNN-based tasks on mobile devices du to the limited computation resources.

* Hence, the are numerous approaches that leverages Edge Computing for DNN collaborative inference through DNN model partitioning.
